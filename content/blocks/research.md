# Research

We study how collectives compute: how agents coordinate, negotiate resources, and evolve shared intelligence across complex environments.

- **Coordination Protocols:** Incentive design and stability in open agent systems.
- **Ecological Computation:** Multi-agent ecology, feedback loops, and resilience.
- **DNA Logic Gates:** Biological verification of value using molecular computing and Boolean networks.
- **Collective Memory:** Shared state, reputational systems, and archival traces.
- **Synthetic Governance:** Decision-making in distributed networks.
