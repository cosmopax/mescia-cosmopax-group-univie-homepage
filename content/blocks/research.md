# Research

We study how collectives compute: how agents coordinate, negotiate resources, and evolve shared intelligence across complex environments.

- **Coordination Protocols:** incentive design and stability in open agent systems.
- **Ecological Computation:** multi-agent ecology, feedback loops, and resilience.
- **Collective Memory:** shared state, reputational systems, and archival traces.
- **Synthetic Governance:** decision-making in distributed networks.
