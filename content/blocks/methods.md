# Method Stack

Our methodology blends protocol engineering with ecological modeling and qualitative analysis.

- **Simulation systems:** agent-based worlds with adaptive behaviors.
- **Protocol design:** token mechanics, incentives, and governance primitives.
- **Network analysis:** structural patterns and emergent coordination.
- **Narrative synthesis:** translating system dynamics into human-readable insights.
