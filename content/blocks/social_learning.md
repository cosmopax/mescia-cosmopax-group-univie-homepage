# Social Learning

We investigate how knowledge propagates through hybrid networks of human and artificial agents. Our models focus on:

* **Information Cascades**: How simple signals trigger complex collective shifts.
* **Cultural Evolution**: The replication and mutation of memes in algorithmic environments.
* **Trust Topology**: Mapping the structure of reliable information flow.
