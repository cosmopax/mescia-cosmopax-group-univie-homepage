# Social Learning & Multi-Agent Economics

Intelligence is not a solitary phenomenon. We model AGI as a collective emergent property of social interaction.

* **Social Reinforcement Learning:** Agents learning "Theory of Mind" by competing for resources in complex, open-ended economies.
* **Agential Markets:** Simulation of distributed ledger systems where agents trade computational resources and information.
* **Cultural Transmission:** Mechanisms for agents to pass learned behaviors to subsequent generations, bypassing the need for "zero-shot" learning.
