# Signal Arrays

We track real-time signals across simulations and live systems to understand how collective intelligence emerges.

- **Swarm telemetry:** agent density, coupling, and phase shifts.
- **Protocol trace:** incentive flows and consensus dynamics.
- **Memory lattices:** distributed memory and semantic alignment.
- **Field probes:** experiments embedded in civic and ecological sites.
