# Mescia Cosmopax Group

We are a research group at the University of Vienna exploring distributed intelligence, cryptoeconomic coordination, and emergent governance in synthetic ecologies.

Our work blends computational models, protocol design, and ecological thinking to study how agent collectives learn, adapt, and self-organize at scale.
